# Triviagame

This page was made to help understand how to manipulate the DOM batter using jQuery and Javascript. The goal of this activity was to also 
to include a timer while a person does a trivia game. The code is made to add up the score when done, and nearly all elements were
made in a javascript file instead of directly through HTML.
